      <h1>SparkSat Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: June 24, 2025</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>SparkSat is a cryptocurrency wallet browser extension
  designed for the Spark protocol. We are committed to protecting
  your privacy and ensuring the security of your digital assets. This
   privacy policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

      <h2>Data Collection</h2>
      <p>SparkSat does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal
  user data. Our extension operates entirely locally on your device.
  We do not:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Collect personal information such as names, email
  addresses, or phone numbers</li>
          <li>Track your browsing activity or website visits</li>
          <li>Store transaction data on external servers</li>
          <li>Share any information with third parties</li>
          <li>Use analytics or tracking services</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
      <p>SparkSat stores the following data locally on your device
  using Chrome's storage API:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Encrypted wallet private keys and seed phrases</li>
          <li>Wallet configuration and settings</li>
          <li>Transaction history and cache data</li>
          <li>User preferences and interface settings</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All sensitive data is encrypted using industry-standard
  encryption algorithms before being stored locally. This data never
  leaves your device.</p>

      <h2>Blockchain Interactions</h2>
      <p>When you perform transactions, SparkSat interacts directly
  with blockchain networks. These interactions are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Broadcast directly to the blockchain network</li>
          <li>Publicly recorded on the blockchain (as is standard for
   all blockchain transactions)</li>
          <li>Not routed through our servers</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>SparkSat may connect to:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Blockchain RPC nodes for network connectivity</li>
          <li>Decentralized applications (DApps) that you explicitly
  choose to interact with</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These connections are made directly by your browser and are
  not mediated by our servers.</p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>We implement several security measures:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>All private keys and sensitive data are encrypted
  before local storage</li>
          <li>No user data is transmitted to external servers</li>
          <li>The extension operates with minimal required
  permissions</li>
          <li>Regular security audits of our codebase</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>SparkSat is not intended for use by children under 18 years
  of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from
  children.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any
  changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision
  date.</p>

      <h2>Open Source</h2>
      <p>SparkSat is committed to transparency. Our code is open
  source and can be audited by the community to verify our privacy
  practices.</p>
